SCRIBE
  document release method
  request_volume_permission takes two subs??
  one of those subs crams an object into a message?

TAPER
  split START_TAPER into START_TAPER and START_WORKER
  distinguish "scribe" from "worker", better worker abst (they're called 'tapers' in driver!)
  automate delegation
  workers should have "parent" pointer
  taper states comment misplaced
  taper uses $selfW/$selfC -- change back
  fix Worker->new arg parsing
  state assertions are commented out - covering up bugs?!

What is this scribe handoff stuff?
 - one scribe steals the dump in progress from another, without replacing the devhandling

driver assert(0)?

driver startaflush -- options ordered by preference?

why is driverio's tapertable static?

xfer->set_callback
  -> needs docs
  -> timing issues?

reorg taper to do better message delegation

DOCS
  Scribe docs need updating
   - release method
   - new_scribe in volume_cb
  Trace logfile changes?
  Driver/Taper Protocol
  Manpage needs more description of multi-taper.. what are "drives"?
  $sfer->set_callback(..)
