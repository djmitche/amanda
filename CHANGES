	Change amrecover/amindexd/amidxtaped to require a SECURITY
	exchange if --with-bsd-security is enabled.  It is done on a

	Make our internal TEXTDB the default database style for the infofile.

	option "--with-db={db,dbm,gdbm,ndbm}".
	-scott

	Sanitise the disk name in the TEXTDB code.
	**NOTE** if your infofile database uses TEXTDB (which has only been
		 available since Amanda-2.4.0b1) and you have '/'s in the
		 first field in disklist you will need to 'amadmin export'
		 the data using the old version of Amanda, 'mv' the old
		 database out of the way and 'amadmin import' it back again
		 using the new version.  When you are happy with the new
		 version you may delete the old database.

	Get rid of DEV_ROOT/DEV_RROOT and figure out the raw name on the
	fly by trying a leading 'r' before each path element one at a time
	until we find a character device.  This should handle all the current
	cases plus things like Solaris DiskSuite that have /dev/md/rdsk/xxx
	names.  -JJ

	Change kill logic in sendsize to try TERM first, then KILL if that
	does not get dump's attention.  This fixes a problem on AIX 4.x
	where dump was always getting a KILL and leaving orphaned message
	queues, which would eventually run the system out of resources.  -JJ

	Extensive buffer management, bug and defensive coding overhaul
	including:
	    * Use proper fgets/fread/read buffer size.
	    * Wrote agets and areads to get a line without buffer overflow
	      and changed most gets/fgets and some read calls to use it.
	    * Replaced all *scanf("...%s...") with explicit pointer work.
	    * Replaced most fixed size buffers with dynamic ones.  This has
	      no doubt introduced some memory leaks.
	    * Replaced most sprintf calls with vstralloc (new routine).
	    * Added overflow checks to some remaining explicit buffer
	      management.
	    * Made almost all read() and write() calls into loops to handle
	      short and broken up transfers.
	    * Fixed potentially uninitialized fstype field.
	    * Added more sanity checks when parsing various things, including
	      converting some assert() calls to real code.
	    * The pattern amtrmidx used to find old index files to delete
	      thought the date field was YYYY-MM-DD, but it is YYYYMMDD,
	      so no files were being deleted.
	    * Limited the number of directories listed by amflush to 26 to
	      avoid funny characters in the user prompt.
	    * Changed some of the amrecover routines to soak up the rest of
	      the continuation lines after an error.
	    * If a dumper dies, driver still tries to send a QUIT command
	      which fails because the file descriptor has been closed.
	    * Wrote afree macro that calls free and then sets the pointer
	      to NULL.  Changed most free calls to afree.
	    * Wrote aclose/afclose/apclose macros to do the associated close
	      and then set the argument to something invalid (-1 or NULL).
	    * Check the file descriptor before calling FD_ISSET in dumper.
	      Otherwise it goes to -1 on EOF and FD_* doesn't like that.
	    * Call aclose() after FD_CLR (so the descriptor is not -1).
	Odds and ends:
	    * Added some TEXTDB support code to the infofile test program.
	    * Set it up so -DPROTO_DEBUG could come from the compiler command
	      line instead of having to modify the source.
	    * Added -t command line flag code to sendbackup.c to support some
	      limited debugging.
	    * Added a test to amcheck to see if the log file is writable
	      (if it already exists).  During debugging, I keep leaving one
	      around owned by root :-).
	    * Changed upper limit on close loops from 255 to FD_SETSIZE.
	      This probably needs some more study.

	Make sure SAMBA will not clear archive bits when performing an

	-martineau

	Add a LOGDIR option to amanda.conf and use it to replace the
	--with-logdir option to configure (this was only used for the
	amdump files) and the logfile option in amanda.conf.  Log
	files are now LOGDIR/log and amdump files are LOGDIR/amdump.
	Note: if there is a LOGFILE option in amanda.conf it has its
	filename removed and is used as the LOGDIR (eg, if you have
	"logfile /usr/adm/amanda/log" in amanda.conf it is translated to
	"logdir /usr/adm/amanda" instead).  This should not cause a
	problem for most sites.
	-scott

	Remove --with-dbdir option from configure.  This was only used
	to setup things for the man pages and example files.  Oh.. and
	amrmtape.  Fix this as well.

	This is no longer tested on configure.in, since it is
	expressly forbidden to include kernel headers under glibc,

Version 2.3.0.4

	Have bsd_security_ok() in amandad return 1 when BSD security is
	not turned on.  Patch from Michael C. Grant
	<mcgrant@rascals.Stanford.EDU>.

	Add a configure option, --with-db, which lets the user specify
	the database library to use.  The available codes to look for
	are db,dbm,gdbm,ndbm.  The new configure code goes to a lot
	more length to find pairs of header files and libraries.  If a
	header file exists and the library does not, but dbm_open() is
	found by linking against -lc, then that header file is used.
	Patch from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Fixed bug at line 158 where selfcheck was testing that the
	result returned by open() was nonzero.  The correct thing to do
	is check for non-negative values returned by open().  Changed
	the "ERROR" in line 169 to "OK" to prevent selfcheck from
	flagging the non-existence of /etc/amandapass as an error.
	Using "OK" in this line flags this condition as an informative
	statement rather than an error - which is to say this will be
	reported along with other errors but it isn't enough in itself
	to generate an error report.  The reason that I think this is
	the right fix is because although every Amanda client is
	capable of backing up PCs using smbclient it isn't the case
	that we will back up PCs with every Amanda client.  This also
	implies that we don't want to have /etc/amandapass files on all
	these machines either.  If an Amanda client does have a samba
	"//host/share" entry in its disklist file then selfcheck will
	flag the non-existence of the /etc/amandapass file on line 105
	when it attempts to check that partition, so I believe that
	this is a safe fix.  Patch from Michael Brantley
	<Michael-Brantley@deshaw.com>.

	Have all calls to gethostname() leave the result in character
	arrays of length 1025.  This will make sure that gethostname
	behaves correctly.  Patch from  blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Have amrecover.c include history.h or readline/history.h if
	configure finds it.  Patch from blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Have Amanda use cat if gzip and compress cannot be found.  In
	this case, do not #define COMPRESS_FAST_OPT, COMPRESS_BEST_OPT,
	or UNCOMPRESS_OPT as "" since cat will look look for a file by
	the name of "".  Place #ifdef's around code that uses any of
	the _OPT defines.  Patch from Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Rewrite amgetidx to use amandad instead of rsh/rcp.  amgetidx
	now only gets the index files from a given day.  It now takes
	two optionally arguments <on day> or <ago days>.  <on day> lets
	the user specify the day in one of the forms YYYYMMDD MMDD DD
	YYYY-MM-DD --MM-DD ---DD.  <ago days> gets the files from days
	days ago.  Have configure look for an appropriate directory to
	use for the temporary files on the clients.  Use /var/tmp, then
	/usr/tmp, and if neither of those exist, then use /tmp.  Have
	selfcheck check if the index holding directory has enough space
	in it.  Add a new program called sendindex which sends the
	index files.  Add the file docs/INDEXING which describes the
	index code.  Patch from Alan McIvor <alan@auck.irl.cri.nz>.

	Have configure set up mt to use either the -f or the -t option
	depending upon the operating system.  Patch from Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Include the amanda_tapetypes.txt file as docs/TAPETYPES.  File
	composed by Chris Stacey <chris@snrc.uow.edu.au>.

	Allow certain dumptypes to be kicked off at specific times.
	Add a new, optional, parameter to the dumptype description in
	the config file.  The parameter is called "starttime" and takes
	one argument which is a time of day (local timezone) formated
	as either hhmm or hmm (no `.'s, no `:'s, just an integer).
		define dumptype comp-user-2am {
			comment "Non-root partitions on fast machines"
			options compress-fast
			priority medium
			starttime 0200
		}
	Any partitions listed in disklist with this dumptype will be
	fired off no earlier than 2am.  If 2am today is less than 43200
	seconds past (12 hours ago) it will assume you meant 2am today
	and fire the dumps off right away.  But if 2am today is more
	than 12 hours in the past, it will wait till 2am tomorrow.
	Patch from Brad Huntting <huntting@misc.glarp.com>.

	Totally rewrite the socket buffering code for dumper.
	Eliminate SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO setsockopt calls.  Remove
	the check for HAVE_SO_SNDTIMEO from configure.  Add a new
	option to configure named --enable-buffered-dump to enable this
	code.  Patch from Brad Huntting <huntting@misc.glarp.com>.

	Have amflush call setsid() to detach amflush from the
	controlling terminal.  Patch from Ken Laprade
	<klaprade@harris.com>.

	Have configure correctly work on systems where dbm_open is in
	libc.  Patch from Farzad Farid <farzy@sgip.fr>.

	Patches to amrmtape which remove C style comments and let the
	script remove a tape if there is only one tape in the tapelist
	file.  Patch from Andrew A. Ivanov <IVANOV@mics.msu.su>.

	Sprintf formatting error in amgetidx fixed.  Patch from Yossi
	Gottlieb <yogo@xpert.com>.

	I'm using a Sony SDT/STL-7000 4mm DAT changer.  I could not
	find any method of directly controlling the device, except for
	simply using the 'offline' mt command for advancing to the next
	tape.  Using this method, however, I could not go beyond the
	last cassette (that is, to roll back to the first one).  This
	means the device is currently being used as a simple gravity
	changer, only able to change forward.  The chg-generic.conf
	should list the default tape device for all slots, disable
	'needeject', enable 'gravity' and enable the new option named
	'multieject'.  Patch from Yossi Gottlieb <yogo@xpert.com>.

	Update the example chg-generic.conf file to include comments
	that describe how to use the multieject feature of the script.
	Patch from Yossi Gottlieb <yogo@xpert.com>.

	Protocol seems to loop when a A_TIMEOUT occurs because
	p->reqtries was not being decremented.  Problem noted by Neal
	Becker <neal@ctd.comsat.com>.

	About half the calls to gethostname() in Amanda fail to
	null-terminate properly.  This patch makes them all
	consistent.  In addition it updates sendbackup-dump and
	sendbackup-gnutar so they handle USE_FQDN is a way consistent
	with the amindex stuff.  In particular when USE_FQDN is set,
	the dump clients will not truncate their hostname before
	putting it in the dump headers.  My patches to amflush are
	already in the Amanda betas so amflush should be able to match
	up both FQDN and non-FQDN clients against FQDN and non-FQDN
	disklist files.  I also fixed an error message that was
	attributed to gethostname when it actually came from
	getpeername.  Patches from James Mathiesen
	<james@nyc.deshaw.com>.

	I have run into the problem, on a Linux system, where the first
	time I run configure it generates valid Makefiles and Amanda
	compiles without problem.  If I run configure again, or I alter
	a Makefile.in or something which causes autoconf to be called,
	the resulting Makefiles are no good - the programs in
	server-src don't finish linking because there is no dbm
	library.  That is, the first time through configure -lgdbm is
	added to LIBS but the second, and any subsequent times, it is
	not.  Patch from Alan McIvor <alan@auck.irl.cri.nz>.

	I've just found a bug that has prevented Amanda from running on
	my site for almost one week.  Just after a dumper replied that
	it timed-out, the driver would send it another dump request.
	Then the driver would log to amdump an event of receiving a
	message from the dumper, but that message would be empty, the
	holding file for the requested filesystem would not exist, and
	driver would quit.  It turned out that the problem was that
	dumper started to close its sockets (datafd, mesgfd and outfd)
	since release 2.3.0.4b3.  outfd is initialized before invoking
	startup_dump, but it is sendbackup_response, intended to be
	invoked by the amandad protocol driver, that opens sockets and
	initializes datafd and mesgfd.  If sendbackup_response is never
	run (because the amandad request times out), datafd and mesgfd
	will not be initialized, so they may contain already closed
	(and possibly already reopened) file descriptor numbers or
	still be uninitialized, containing any garbage, but usually 0
	--- but 0 is stdin, used for reading commands from the driver,
	it should not be closed!  I've solved the problem by
	initializing them to -1 in startup_dump.  Patch from Alexandre
	Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	Include declarations for select(), bind(), connect(), fread(),
	fwrite(), getopt(), getpeername(), getsockname(), getsockopt(),
	initgroups(), listen(), lstat(), mktemp(), mktime(), puts(),
	recvfrom(), select(), sendto(), setpgrp(), setsockopt(),
	shmat(), shmctl(), shmdt(), shmget(), socketpair(), sscanf(),
	strftime(), strncasecmp(), system() if the system does not
	declare these in any header files.  Patch from Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Have configure correctly substitute for DB_DIR and LOG_DIR in
	example/amanda.conf when --prefix was not used.  Problem noted
	by Philippe Charnier <charnier@xp11.frmug.org>.

	Include seagate-changer.c from Larry D. Pyeatt
	<pyeatt@cs.colostate.edu>.  This program was written to control
	the Seagate/Conner/Archive autoloading DAT drive.  This drive
	normally has 4 tape capacity but can be expanded to 12 tapes
	with an optional tape cartridge.  This program may also work on
	other drives.  This program works for me under Linux with Gerd
	Knorr's <kraxel@cs.tu-berlin.de> SCSI media changer driver
	installed as a kernel module.  The kernel module is available
	at
	http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/scsi/scsi-changer*
	Since the Linux media changer is based on NetBSD, this program
	should also work for NetBSD, although I have not tried it.  It
	may be necessary to change the IOCTL calls to work on other
	OS's.

	Add a new configure option, --with-group, which tells Amanda
	the group to install all files as.  Patch from Alexandre Oliva
	<oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	If --with-bsd-security was not set, then dumper would not find
	the amanda/udp port to use to connect to clients.  Patch from
	Alan McIvor <alan@auck.irl.cri.nz>.

	The order of dump programs to search for (ufsdump, vdump, dump,
	backup) didn't work on AIX systems, where backup should be used
	but a program named dump exists on the system.  Patch by Blair
	Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	The configure --with-mmap was not working properly since
	configure was using the wrong variable to see if the system had
	a working mmap().  Problem noted by Keith Mitchell
	<kmitch@weenix.guru.org>.

	Fix sendbackup-gnutar so that it can be compiled with a K&R
	compiler.  Patch by Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Since I installed Amanda 2.3.0.4b3, I noticed some annoying
	messages in amdump:
		dumper: pid 8696 setsockopt(SO_SNDTIMEO): Invalid argument
	This is because Solaris 2.5 does declare SO_SNDTIMEO in
	sys/socket.h, but fails to setsockopt with the given
	arguments.  Unfortunately, it is not documented, so I could not
	find out the correct way to do this, so I just added a test in
	configure to check whether SO_SNDTIMEO works as expected or
	not.  Patch from Alexandre Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	Include amplot-2.2.6 written by Olafur Gudmundsson
	<ogud@tis.com> into Amanda.  Have amplot be configured using
	configure instead of amplot.conf.  It will be installed if
	gnuplot and the version of awk configure finds can handle
	variable assignment from the command line.  I also changed some
	of the command line options so that the amdump files will not
	be compressed unless amplot is told to do so on the command
	line.  It also takes a new command line option, -t, which lets
	the user set the time of the right side of the plot.  Work done
	by Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Made rth-changer check all system calls for valid returns.
	Patch by Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	amrestore.c and sendbackup-common.c would do an ifdef on
	HAVE_GZIP, which was no longer being defined if Amanda was
	using gzip.  Now, define HAVE_GZIP if gzip is being used.
	Patch by Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Include a script, amoverview, that outputs an overview of all
	of the backups done on all of the disks.  Script written by
	Dave Disser <disser@sdd.hp.com>.

	The prototype for amname_to_fstype() is missing in
	createindex-dump.c when xfsdump is available.  Patch from Ken
	Laprade <klaprade@harris.com>.

	Apparently SGI provides a dummy libsun.a that does not really
	have anything in it.  I guess this tricks configure into adding
	it to the Makefile.  Have configure not check for libsun.a on
	SGI systems.  Patch from Ken Laprade <klaprade@harris.com>.

	The global variable overwrite in amcheck.c apparently is seen
	as a potential conflict with the overwrite() curses function
	which is apparently in SGI's libtermcap.a.  Declaring the
	variable static eliminates the warning.  Patch from Ken Laprade
	<klaprade@harris.com>.

	Add a new configure option, --with-fqdn, which allows Amanda to
	back up systems in different domains.  This requires that the
	disklist file have the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)
	listed.  Patch from Joe Ammond <Joe.Ammond@ee.gatech.edu>.

	Include rundump, a setuid program that runs dump as root.  This
	is used under OSF1 systems.  Patch from Alexandre Oliva
	<oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	Install setuid files executable only by the owner and group of
	the files.  This stops other users from running these programs,
	making security tighter.  Patch from Alexandre Oliva
	<oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	On FreeBSD 3.0, amanda.h needs to include <sys/types.h> before
	<dirent.h>.  Problem noted by Keith Mitchell
	<kmitch@weenix.guru.org>.

	Amanda had a bug regarding the recent addition of support for
	excluding files in GNUTAR.  planner and sendsize did not
	understand each other about empty exclusion lists, so there
	were failures using gnutar, as dump does not support excludes.
	Patch from Alexandre Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	Fixed a problem in configure where DUMP was being set to
	/no/restore/available when no restore program could be found
	instead of setting RESTORE to this.  Patch from Alexandre Oliva
	<oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	Have no-changer and hp-changer check for the existence of the
	logging directory before trying to use it.  Patch by Blair
	Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Patches to have nicer looking Samba support code.  Patch from
	Michael Zucchi <cismpz@cis.unisa.edu.au>.

	Got Amanda to compile fine on a m88k-motorola-sysv4 system.
	Patches from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	In amandad.c, pk_t dupmsg was conflicting with dupmsg in
	/usr/include/sys/stream.h on an m88k-motorola-sysv4 system.
	Rename dupmsg to dup_msg.  To keep things consistent, rename
	inmsg to in_msg and outmsg to out_msg.  Patch by Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Check for the dbm_open declaration in any header file that may
	contain it.  If it doesn't exist, then declare it and all of
	the other dbm_ functions.  Check if struct datum is declared in
	any header files and if it isn't then declare it.  Patch from
	Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Have runtar make sure that it is being invoked by the
	CLIENT_LOGIN user, since it is a suid executable.  Patch from
	Alexandre Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	Have selfcheck check for /etc/vdumpdates if vdump is being
	used.  Patch from Alexandre Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	If we're on an Ultrix system, then define STATFS_ULTRIX.  Patch
	by Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	amadmin export produces a full version number (2.3.0.4b2, for
	instance), while amadmin import expects three integers
	separated by dots, so it fails to import an exported file by
	itself.  Patch by Alexandre Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	Sendsize.c would loop forever if debugging was not turned on.
	Patch from Alexandre Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	Define STATFS_OSF1 if we are on a *-dec-osf-* system.  Change
	ifdef OSF1_HANG_BUG to ifdef OSF1_VDUMP, since I'd rather not
	have too many defines floating around.  Patch by Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	There was a bug in selfcheck.c when Blair installed the Samba
	support.  I deleted an extra space that was added after
	SAMBA_CLIENT when the command was being put together.  Fix by
	Michael Zucchi <cismpz@cis.unisa.edu.au>.

	Add a needed ; to client-src/Makefile.am and
	server-src/Makefile.am.  Patch from Alexandre Oliva
	<oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	Have planner.c and amcheck.c always get the amanda port number
	even if BSD security is turned off.  Patch by Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Change the way amgetidx caches host up/down information.  It
	used to stralloc() a string depending on if the host was up or
	down.  Now, create two static character arrays, one holding
	"down" and the other holding "up" and simply point the
	hostinfo->up pointer to one of the two arrays.  This should
	save a little memory.  Patch by Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	The Bourne shell in FreeBSD can't handle setting IFS to : and
	expanding $LOCPATH:$SYSPATH.  Create two new variables before
	their use called $LOCSYSPATH and $SYSLOCPATH.  Patch by Blair
	Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Have open_fstab for BSD systems return the value of setfsent.
	Patch by Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Configure was searching for the dump program in the following
	order: ufsdump, vdump, backup, dump.  On HP-UX systems,
	configure would find backup, which is a valid program but does
	not do what dump does.  So switch the order of the programs to
	ufsdump, vdump, dump, backup.  Patch by Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Fixed some dbprintf(()) bugs in amgetidx.c.  Patch by Blair
	Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Have amrecover.c always declare
	    extern char *optarg;
	    extern int optind;
	This makes amrecover.c compile on Ultrix systems.  Problem
	noted by Scott Gasch <scott@cray-ymp.acm.stuorg.vt.edu>.

	Patch to configure to have it recognize gnutar version 1.11.2.
	Patch from Alexandre Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

Version 2.3.0.4b2

	Have amcleanup, no-changer, and hp-changer find out where the
	logging directory, or amdump error file is from getconf instead
	of using @LOG_DIR@ or @DB_DIR@ from configure.  Problem noted
	by Joe Ammond <Joe.Ammond@ee.gatech.edu>.

	Remove VarDir=@DB_DIR@ from amrmtape.sh.in, since amrmtape
	figures out where the curinfo files are from the amanda.conf
	file.  Problem noted by Joe Ammond <Joe.Ammond@ee.gatech.edu>.

	Include rth-changer, a tape changer script for the Robotic Tape
	Handling system OEM'd by Andataco (RTH-406).  Script written by
	Erik Frederick <edf@tyrell.mc.duke.edu>.

	Add a new configure option called --with-pid-debug-files which
	has Amanda append the process ID to the debugging files placed
	in /tmp.  The PID will not be appended unless this option is
	used.  Suggestion by Joe Ammond <Joe.Ammond@ee.gatech.edu>.

	Add a new #define UNCOMPRESS_OPT to pass to UNCOMPRESS_PATH to
	get compressed standard input decompressed and pass it to
	standard output.  The configure script only recognized gzip and
	compress right now, so it will set UNCOMPRESS_OPT to -dc and
	set UNCOMPRESS_PATH to the same value as COMPRESS_PATH.  Edit
	all of the files that make use of UNCOMPRESS_PATH to also make
	use of UNCOMPRESS_OPT now.  Patch by Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	The readline() substitute in amrecover.c when the real
	readline() code is not available did not return to the caller
	what the user typed in.  It now does so.  Patch from Blair
	Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Avoid -lnsl on Irix.  On IRIX 5.x and 6.x systems that have the
	svr4net module installed, there will be a /usr/lib/libnsl.so
	present on the system. The configure script looks for this and
	tosses into the library list if it's there.  It is not
	advisable to link against libnsl on IRIX unless you really need
	it for SVR4 networking (TLI/STREAMS). If you _do_ link against
	it, you should use include '-lc' _before_ '-lnsl'. The reason
	for this is that libnsl.so also contains the SysV TI-RPC code,
	which is RPC based on STREAMS/TLI rather than sockets. (Solaris
	2.x now uses this by default.) TI-RPC has some compatibility
	functions with the same names as older RPC functions, such as
	clnt_call(), clnt_create(), clnt_destroy(), and these conflict
	with the functions in libc.so. The main place this will hose
	you is NIS: NIS v2 expects the underlying RPC code to use
	sockets, not STREAMS, and it fails if the TI-RPC symbols in
	libnsl.so override the RPC symbols in libc.so.  Again, you
	don't need libnsl.so unless you're actually using STREAMS/TLI
	or TI-RPC, so in Amanda's case it's safe to just ignore it. If
	you _do_ need it, you must do 'cc -o foo foo.c -lc -lnsl' in
	order to make sure the linker resolves the RPC symbol
	references correctly. The primary symptom of this problem is
	that things like getpwent(), getgrent() and getnetgrent() stop
	working in an NIS environment.  To make a long story short: on
	IRIX, avoid using libnsl. Amanda doesn't need it anyway. So far
	I haven't encountered a problem with this, but you never know.
	Note from Bill Paul <wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu>.

	Include patches to have Amanda do incrementals of gnutar based
	backups.  Patch from Alexandre Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	Delete the GNUTAR_BROKEN_PIPE from configure and acconfig.h
	since no code was testing for it.  Patch by Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Have configure check for the number of arguments that
	gettimeofday takes and have clock.c use the appropriate number
	of arguments.  Patch by Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Have sendbackup-common.c include tapeio.h instead of defining
	BUFFER_SIZE.  Fix by Philip Guenther <guenther@gac.edu>.

	Put in more support for AIX by defining AIX_BACKUP if the
	system is an AIX system.  Fix createindex-dump.c to pass the -B
	flag to restore to have it read from standard input.  Problem
	noted by Bill Paul <wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu>.  Patch by Blair
	Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Add a regexp for AIX 4's backup in sendbackup-dump.c and
	sendsize.c.  Patch from Bill Paul <wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu>.

	Add a comment to tapeio.h about BUFFER_SIZE and what it is used
	for and how people should not change it.  Noted by Bill Paul
	<wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu>.

	Added a --with-mmap option to force the use of mmap() instead
	of shared memory support.  Requested by wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu
	<Bill Paul>.  Patch by Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	On FreeBSD 2.x and 3.x, the SO_SNDTIMEOUT value is too large in
	dumper.c.  Looking at the kernel source, the maximum value for
	tv_sec is about 227.  The value used is READ_TIMEOUT/4, or
	(30*60)/4 == 450 seconds.  This causes setsockopt() to return
	EDOM (Numerical argument out of domain), and again everything
	grinds to a halt.  I changed the value from READ_TIMEOUT/4 to
	READ_TIMEOUT/8, which reduces the SO_SNDTIMEO value to 225.  I
	haven't extensively tested this yet, but based on eyeballing
	the kernel source it should work.  Patch from Bill Paul
	<wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu>.

	In dumper.c:do_dump(), there is code to set the transmission
	timeout, receive buffer size and receive low water mark on the
	data socket using setsockopt().  For SO_RECVBUF, the receive
	buffer size (recbuf) is set to DATABUF_SIZE * 4, which is
	32*1024*4, or 131072.  On SunOS 4.1.x, this value is too
	large:  dumper generates a 'no buffer space available' error
	and everything grinds to a halt.  I took away the '*4', which
	reduces the size to 32767 bytes, which seems to work.  I'm
	surprised nobody else has noticed this since it breaks SunOS
	Amanda servers.  I can only surmise that people aren't using
	SunOS machines as servers these days. :)   Patch from Bill Paul
	<wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu>.

	Have Amanda include either readline.h or readline/readline.h
	Fix suggested by Neal Becker <neal@ctd.comsat.com>.

	Have --with-includes put the -I flags into $CPPFLAGS and
	$CFLAGS so that AC_CHECK_HEADERS will find other include
	files.  Problem noted by Neal Becker <neal@ctd.comsat.com>.

	Fixed common-src/Makefile.am to put the extra libamanda.a
	sources into the EXTRA_libamanda_a_SOURCES variable instead of
	EXTRA_DIST.  Fix from Tom Tromey <tromey@drip.Colorado.EDU>.

	When compiling amgetidx.c with some compilers, trigraph
	substitutions were being made when they should not have been.
	Protect the code from this.  Patch from Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Test for flock support in the following order:
		1) POSIX fcntl file locking
		2) flock locking
		3) lockf locking
	The common-src/flock.c file will only be used if the lockf type
	locking is needed on this system.  Patch from Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Have Samba support compile in only if requested by the user.
	Patch from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Configure was not using $CFLAGS and $CPPFLAGS when trying to
	calculate the select argument type.  Patch from Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Updated amanda.h to include alloca.h if the system has it and
	if it's ok to include.  Also protect more include files with
	#ifdefs found by configure.  Patch from Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Linux does not use the raw device names to do backups.
	configure now checks to see if it can find a raw disk device
	file whose name is built from root's mount point.  If it can't,
	then set RDEV_PREFIX to use /dev/ instead of /dev/r.  Fix
	suggested by Brian <brian.s.mogged@uwrf.edu> and Ken Latta
	<latta@parc.xerox.com>.

	Fixed const cast message from regex.c.  Problem noted by Ken
	Laprade <klaprade@harris.com>.  Patch from Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Configure was not checking for the OSF1_VDUMP #ifdef used in
	Amanda.  It now will set OSF1_VDUMP if vdump is found on the
	system.  However, it does not check if the system is really a
	OSF system.  Patch from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Have configure check for asm/byteorder.h for
	sparc-unknown-linux-gnu.  Problem noted by Eric Doutreleau
	<ed@cti.ecp.fr>.

	Remove the check for libintl.h from configure.  It was only
	being used for regex.c, which really didn't need it.  Patch
	from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Convert all code to K&R C by trying to compile Amanda using
	/usr/bin/cc on a SunOS 4.1.1 machine.  Have configure check if
	the compiler can handle the volatile keyword and if it can't,
	#define it to empty in the config.h file.  Patch from Blair
	Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Move the contents of versuff.h into version.h and remove
	versuff.h.  Add a new function called version() which returns
	the version string.  Use version() in some of the programs.
	Patch from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	m88k-motorola-sysv4 systems define L_FAIL, which is used by
	logfile.h.  Undefine it in logfile.h.  Patch from Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Include amindex-1.0 from Alan McIvor.  It includes these
	improvements over 0.3:
		Amrecover now provides the ability to restore files
		from the tapes, via the "extract" command.

		Support for gnutar based index generation (but not file
		restoration yet).

		Numerous bug fixes.

	Have amgetidx try to open a socket to the shell/tcp port on the
	remote machine and cache if it succeeds.  If it connection
	attempt succeeds, then attempt to get the index files over from
	the client.  Patch from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Update patch-system to include the amidxtape service at
	10083/tcp.  Patch from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Configure said that the server configuration was OK and then
	next said it wasn't.  Remove these checks.  Patch from Blair
	Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Fixed building Amanda for multiple architectures in
	subdirectories of Amanda.  Problem noted by Thomas Hepper
	<Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

Version 2.3.0.4b1

	Fix a problem with `amadmin <conf> balance' dumping core.  If
	some disks are overdue, they are stored in the sequence array
	with a negative index.  This has the potential to cause memory
	corruption, and it makes the reported balance figures not add up
	to the same as the total.  Since overdue disks are really going
	to be candidated for today's backups, they are thrown in the
	bin for those.  Patch from Ken Laprade <klaprade@harris.com>.

	Add Samba client support using smbclient to Amanda.  Samba must
	be patched with the file patches/samba-1.9.16p2.1.patch - this
	is a patch for 1.9.16p2 of Samba, and modifies the way the
	'dir' command works, and adds totals to both the dir command
	and the tar command, via stderr.  These are used by amanda to
	estimate and count backup sizes.  This should be installed on
	an amanda 'client' host, that will act as the 'samba server'
	host.  This will most likely be the same machine as the Amanda
	master server.  Patches from Michael Zucchi
	<zucchi@cis.unisa.edu.au>.

	Amrmtape converted from Bash to Bourne shell.  Patch from Blair
	Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Fix the indexing code to use "arglist.h" instead of <stdarg.h>
	Patch from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Have amdump call amgetidx and amtrmidx.  Put amgetidx and
	amtrmidx into the libexec directory instead of the bin
	directory, since Amanda users will not use these by hand.
	Patch from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Modified diskfile.c to match hostname in the backup header
	against the fully qualified domain name in disklist file,
	because amflush fails in a multidomain backup environment, as
	backup headers have only the hostname.  Patch from Karl
	Lehenbauer <karl@neosoft.com>.

	Have autoconf figure out if some functions are not declared and
	if they are not, then declare them.  Patch from Blair Zajac
	<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Add security fixes to amandad.c.  It now checks the forward and
	reverse DNS names for consistency.  Added a configure option
	--amandahosts to use Michael's code to use .amandahosts instead
	of .rhosts.  Patch from Michael Douglass <mikedoug@texas.net>.

	Add amverify, a simple shell script to check Amanda tapes -
	gnutar driven backups only.  Patch from Thomas Hepper
	<Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	Add the version option to amadmin (eg amadmin <conf> version).
	Patch from Thomas Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	Add the current option to amtape (eg amtape <conf> current).
	This let's you the label of the current tape only without using
	dd.  Patch from Thomas Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	Gnutar support for amindex added.  Patch from Thomas Hepper
	<Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	Calcsize supports exclude-list (gtar).  The source was
	extracted from gnutar itself to be 100% compatible.  Patch from
	Thomas Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	Calcsize checks the file type and ignores special files and
	pipes.  Patch from Thomas Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	Calcsizes calculation for gnu tar archives had a bug (gtar file
	blocks always are a multiple of 2k).  Patch from Thomas Hepper
	<Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	`amandates.c': amdandad suffered by missing AMANDATES_FILE.
	Now it creates this file before missing it.  Patch from Thomas
	Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	`createindex-gnutar.c' added.  Patch from Thomas Hepper
	<Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	alloca(), strdup.c and getcwd added for those system who don't
	have them.  Patch from Thomas Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	A dirty hack for BSD based systems without sigaction(), see
	amanda.h.  Patch from Thomas Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.
 
	Add two scripts, hp-changer and no-changer. hp-changer is a
	tape changer script for a HP DAT changer. Every 10th tape a
	taper clean runs.  no-changer is a changer-like script for
	single tape streamer.  It makes Amanda see a tape changer unit
	with an infinite count of tapes (and requires an operator to
	change the tapes :-)). Every 10 tapes the operator is
	recommended to insert a cleaning tape.  Patch from Thomas
	Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	The version suffix adding is done with a seperate function
	versionsuffix() also available as standalone program.  Patch
	from Thomas Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	Several files got debug support. Patch from Thomas Hepper
	<Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	Added an idle type file-too-large to driver.c to avoid dumping
	files to the holding disk(s) which exceed the maximum file size
	(2 GB on the most 32-bit machines).  Patch from Thomas Hepper
	<Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	Some minor bug fixes, mostly regarding missing or wrong casts
	confusing c compilers (shmat()/shmdt(), select()).  Patch from
	Thomas Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	Genversion gives some more information.  Patch from Thomas
	Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	getfsent.c and statfs.c have been cleaned up. The have to be
	checked on non-Irix/Solaris/NextStep/HPUX/AIX/Linux-systems.
	Patch from Thomas Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	Simple support if readline.a is missing.  NEVER TESTED!  Patch
	from Thomas Hepper <Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.

	Linux requires libdb.a and ndbm.h to handle database files. Not
	really what I expected.  Patch from Thomas Hepper
	<Thomas.Hepper@icem.de>.
 
	Here's a simple patch which fixes a problem that causes amflush
	to erroneously complain "ignoring cruft file" about good dump
	files on the holding disk, and fail to flush them to tape.
	This happens if your holding disk directory has a long name,
	and the dump file also has a long name (i.e. if you use
	filesystem mount points in disklist).  The problem occurs if
	the holding directory + filename exceeds 80 bytes.  The patch
	still leaves a length limitation, but at least it matches the
	size limit imposed by driver (and thus dumper & taper) of 128
	bytes.  Patch from Marion Hakanson <hakanson@cse.ogi.edu>.

	Use regex.h and regex.c from
	ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/sh-utils-1.15.tar.gz instead of the regex
	checking code in the system.  This code includes re_comp and
	re_exec calls, so it will work on any system.  Patch by Blair
	Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Amadmin find reports the wrong tape file numbers after when a
	dump is amflush'ed to tape.  Patch by Ralf Fassel
	<ralf@atg.venture.de>.

	Fix a bug where dumps of disks on the Amanda server are counted
	against the available network bandwidth.  Patch from Marion
	Hakanson <hakanson@cse.ogi.edu>.

	Tell gnutar to not exit with a nonzero value if a read failed.
	This prevents backups from aborting if a file disappeared
	before gnutar could save it.  Patch from Hal Snyder
	<hal@vailsys.com>.

	Fix dumper which can cause the entire amdump run to hang after
	dumper issues a "TRY-AGAIN" message to driver while dumping
	directly to tape.  Patch from Marion Hakanson's
	<hakanson@cse.ogi.edu>.

	Added Marion Hakanson's <hakanson@cse.ogi.edu> patches to fix
	problems when amanda dumps directly to tape (i.e. when holding
	space is full, or you're backing up a huge filesystem, etc.).
	The bug occurs in the way taper determines it has succeeded
	when doing a PORT-WRITE operation (i.e. dumping directly to
	tape).  It used to assume that an EOF meant no more data --
	true if it's reading from a file, but when reading from a port
	(i.e. directly from a dump process), an EOF could signal
	abnormal exit as well as a normal one.  So, I extended the
	protocol between driver and taper when dumping directly to tape
	(see dump_to_tape() in driver.c) so the taper will wait for the
	driver to pass PORT-WRITE-SUCCESS or PORT-WRITE-FAILURE to the
	taper (since driver gets OK/not-OK from the dumper) before the
	taper records success or failure.  Note that this change
	affects only the PORT-WRITE case in taper.  FYI, the bug
	resulted in the curinfo database for a failed port-dump to have
	the tape-label & file-number fields updated with the location
	of the failed dump, even though the timestamp & dump statistics
	still have the values of the last successful dump (the latter
	fields are updated by dumper itself).

	Patches from George Scott <George.Scott@cc.monash.edu.au> to
	fix the following problems in planner.c.
	1) Initialise total_size, total_lev0 and balanced_size.  They
	are updated in analyze_estimates() but never initialised.  Zero
	them before the first call.
	2) Remove oversize dumps.   If there is a dump whose estimated
	size is larger than the tape the planner would tend to throw
	away all the other dumps and then probably generate an
	unworkable plan anyway.  (The standard 2.2.6 planner probably
	tossed these dumps fairly quickly for other reasons, but my
	next fix made this one almost mandatory!)  The fix is to drop
	these enormous dumps right at the begining.  This shouldn't be
	triggered for anyone with a sane configuration.
	3) Promote hills.  There are two ways to create a balanced
	cycle.  The first is to fill in any holes and the second is to
	remove any hills.  The original planner is good at doing the
	first but doesn't even attempt the second.  A quick look at
	"amadmin balance" would show big hills quite clearly.  This fix
	effectively does an "amadmin balance" and promotes a dump from
	one of the "hills".  This type of promotion is quite
	restricted:
	  - don't bother if we already plan to do any level 0 dumps
	  - don't promote a dump if it was going to be the only level 0
	    to be done on that run (ie, ignore hills that are only one
	    dump high)
	  - only promote one level 0 by this method
	  - don't exceed tape_length
	The key to it is the first restriction.  Large sites (with
	large numbers of disks and a large balanced_size) will have at
	least one level 0 scheduled for each day in the dump cycle and
	will already have a balanced cycle.  This code will not
	activate for them.  Small sites will probably not have a level
	0 scheduled and will benefit.  The second restriction will stop
	Amanda from constantly promoting dumps when the schedule is as
	balanced as it will go.  The third restriction will stop Amanda
	over reacting.  Promoting one dump by this method would take
	total_lev0 larger that balanced_size.  If it wouldn't then the
	first stage promotion didn't work like it should.
	4) Initialise got_estimate for all cases.  This fix was from
	der Mouse <mouse@collatz.mcrcim.mcgill.edu>.  "got_estimate"
	wasn't being initialised for skipped disks.  Later in the code
	it was being used in all cases.  The fix is to move its
	initialisation up a few lines.
	5) Explicitly ignore off-line disks.  If a disk is off-line
	when the planner is run it gets -1 for all dump sizes.  These
	were ignored at a later stage.  This fix explicitly ignores
	them up front.
	6) Ignore down machines.  If a machine is down when the planner
	is run it guesses from historical data what the size of
	tonights dump is likely to be and schedules a dump anyway.  The
	dumper then usually discovers that the machine is still down
	and ends up with a half full tape.  Unfortunately the planner
	had to delay another dump because it thought that the tape was
	full.  The fix here is for the planner to discard unavailable
	machines totally rather than just ignore the fact that they are
	unavailable.
	7) Keep at least one total.  Amanda moves level 0 dumps back to
	incrementals to try and fit everything onto the tape.
	Unfortunately if all your incrementals are too big (or your
	tape too small) it can move all of your level 0 dumps.  This
	ends up being a kind of deadlock since, unless a level 0 gets
	done, the incrementals will not reduce in size and until the
	incrementals reduce in size there will not be enough room to
	fit in a level 0.  (This is not quite accurate since a level 4
	dump can get bumped to a level 5 which reduces its size.
	However, this deadlock has happened to me and for many days in
	a row.)  The fix is to pick on the highest priority level 0 and
	not let it be moved.  This change will not affect users with
	reasonably sized tapes since Amanda would not have moved all
	their disks to incrementals.
	8) Make usage of total_lev0 consistent.  "total_lev0" is a
	double and doesn't include tape_mark's.  Make it so.

	Add a fflush(outf) to amcheck.c.  Patch from Mike Russell
	<Michael_Russell@Brown.EDU>.

	Fix problems with amhpfixdevs.  Patch from Michael Schmitz
	<mschmitz@iname.com>.

	Have DEC OSF1 use installbsd instead of install.  Patch from
	Rainer Landes <rlandes@fphws01.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de>.

	Have amcontrol take the first command line argument as the
	configuration to use.  If there are no command line arguments,
	then use daily.  Patch from Thomas Schmeidl
	<schmeidl@nwp.kwu.siemens.de>.

	Removed --atime-preserve from sendbackup-gnutar.c so that
	incremental backups of filesystems will work.  Patch from
	Alexandre Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	Change all #if __STDC__ to #ifdef __STDC__ for those systems
	that define __STDC__ to 0, such as Solaris using cc -Xt, cc
	-Xa.  Patch from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Increase the socket buffer size, and set a low watter mark at
	32k.  This cut the number of syscalls done to process one 32k
	block from dozens down to 4 (select, read, lseek, write).
	Patch from Brad Huntting <huntting@glarp.com>.

	Include amindex-0.3 from Alan McIvor <alan@salan.auck.irl.cri.nz>.

	Add the "srvcompress" option to compress dumps on the tape host
	instead of on the client machines.  This may be useful when a
	fast tape host is backing up slow clients.  The patches add a
	dump-type option, analogous to "compress-fast" or
	"compress-best" - the way to use it is to create a new dumptype
	in your amanda.conf that includes "srvcompress" and use the new
	dumptype for those filesystems you wish to have compressed on
	the tape server. For example, in amanda.conf:
	    define dumptype srvcomp-user {
	    comment "Partitions on slow machines, compressed on tapehost"
	    options srvcompress
	    priority medium
	}
	Patches from Eric Volpe <epv@panix.com>.

	Increase the planner timeout for one estimate from 30 seconds
	to 120 seconds.  Patch from Michael Schmitz
	<mschmitz@iname.com>.

	The select(2) prototype on HPUX specifies 'int' as argument
	type of the filedescriptor arguments. All other systems I know
	of use 'fd_set'. This has been fixed by having configure check
	the argument type to select and adding casts to the select(2)
	calls.  Patch from Michael Schmitz  <mschmitz@iname.com>.

	Improve the diagnostic output and increase the robustness of
	the system by adding better error checking on communication
	between taper & driver, and among the two taper processes.
	Patches from Marion Hakanson <hakanson@cse.ogi.edu>.

	Convert all flock() calls to use POSIX-style locks via the
	fcntl(2) call.  This operation was prompted by the fact that
	the flock() emulation in the Amanda-provided common-src/flock.c
	was broken for read-only file descriptors, and the fcntl(2)
	locks are widely available.  This patch makes it possible to
	have a read-only lock on the /etc/amandates file on systems
	which want to use it.  I've built and tested the patched code
	on Amanda servers running on Digital Unix v3.2B (on Alpha
	hardware) and on SPARC Solaris-2.5.1.  It's also been compiled
	here on SPARC's running SunOS-4.1.3u1b, HP-UX 9.0[345], and
	NeXTstep-3.3 (NeXT hardware).  Note that the patches also
	remove all trace of the NEED_FLOCK define, and I have removed
	the file common-src/flock.c from our source tree here.  Patch
	from Marion Hakanson <hakanson@cse.ogi.edu>.

	For disk/filesystem names which are wider than 14 characters,
	have reporter print out the rightmost characters of the disk
	name, which is usually more meaningful in a daily backup
	summary.  Patch from Marion Hakanson <hakanson@cse.ogi.edu>.

	Lets amflush work in a wider variety of cases than was
	previously true (it used to work if the disklist contains only
	the first token of each hostname).  sendbackup-dump.c and
	sendbackup-gnutar.c now do not trim the domain name from the
	host name that is sent back to the server.  amflush now looks
	for an exact match, in the database.  If it can't find one it
	strips the last token off the dump header hostname and keeps
	trying until it finds a match in the disklist or runs out of
	tokens.  This also has the advantage that if gethostname()
	returns FQDNs and you specify the same FQDNs in the disklist,
	then amflush will always work.  It will also work as long as
	the disklist and gethostname() on the clients return enough
	information to be unambiguous.  Patch from James Mathiesen
	<james@deshaw.com>.

	Increase the READ_TIMEOUT in dumper.c to 30 minutes.  This
	needs to be longer than the longest amount of time dump will
	not produce output.  People have observed dumps taking more
	than 10 minutes to finish mapping some of the passes
	sometimes.  Patch from James Mathiesen <james@deshaw.com>.
	
	Added Adrian T. Filipi-Martin's <atf3r@cs.virginia.edu>
	amrmtape script, which allows you to invalidate the contents of
	an existing backup tape within the Amanda current tape
	database.  This is meant as a recovery mecanism for when a good
	backup is damaged either by faulty hardware or user error,
	i.e.  the tape is eaten by the tape drive, or the tape has been
	overwritten.  Blair Zajac wrote a quick little manual page for
	this script.

	amrmtape was using the return value from amadmin and amadmin
	was exiting with a non-zero value, causing amrmtape to quit.
	Added a return 0 statement to amadmin.c.  Patch from Blair
	Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Went through all of the files and changed void main()'s to int
	main()'s.  Patch from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Removed the 50 tape file limit in amcleanup and amdump.

	createindex-dump and sendbackup-dump did not always take into
	account the version suffix.  This is now handled.  Patch from
	Philippe Charnier <charnier@lirmm.fr>

	Compile and install amrecover and amrestore as client programs,
	not a server program.  The motovation for this is that
	amrecover is truly a program for all of the users on the
	system, while the remaining amanda programs could be used by
	only the system administrator.  Patch from Alexandre Oliva
	<oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

	The program amtrmidx fails to close some of the pipes it uses,
	and this can lead to failure on systems with large numbers of
	disks with incomplete database sets, and file descriptor
	ulimits set.  Patch from Alan McIvor <alan@auck.irl.cri.nz>.

Version 2.3.0.3

	Expanded the width of the DISK column from the reporter
	output.  I like to use mount points like /export/home?? instead
	of device names to back up.  Since the width of the disk name
	field from reporter's output is pretty small, I couldn't easily
	figure out the statistics for a particular partition.  Patch
	from Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

	Included Eric Doutreleau <ed@cti.ecp.fr> patch's for amadmin to
	handle multiple tapes better.  The patch that he posted on used
	a hardwired value of 6 for runtapes, which I changed.

	Included Marion Hakanson's <hakanson@cse.ogi.edu> patches to
	amadmin.c and amadmin.8 to let amadmin use the same disk
	regular expression matching as amrestore.  So now "^/$" will
	match only the root partition, not all of the disks.

	Added a patch from George.Scott@cc.monash.edu.au which makes
	new disks and forces dump with a higher priority.

	Changed tools/munge to delete blank lines and the commented
	lines that the C preprocessor generates (i.e. # 123).  We also
	remove the space after the = sign that can be generated by cpp
	on some systems.

	Installed amindex-0.2 from Alan McIvor <alan@auck.irl.cri.nz>
	with the following patches:

		Fix problem so that rsh'ing on a hpux host works.
		Patch from Neal Becker <neal@ctd.comsat.com>.  This
		patch includes a new #define for RSH_COMMAND, which is
		set to rsh in config-common.h and defined as remsh in
		config.h-hpux.

		Fix bugs in createindex-dump.c when comparing errno to
		EINTR.  The code was using = instead of ==.  Patch from
		Neal Becker <neal@ctd.comsat.com>.  I'm guessing this
		might fix some of the runaway createindex-dump
		processes that I have seen on my system.

		On my system, we use MAE which likes to generate path
		names with spaces in them.  I patched
		createindex-dump.c so that filenames with spaces have
		the whole filename listed.  Patch from Blair Zajac
		<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

		Patch amtrmidx.c so that backups using the mount points
		for disks instead of the device name have the /'s
		replaced with _'s.  Patch from Blair Zajac
		<blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

Version 2.3.0.2

	Changed the signals being sent to xfsdump for Irix so that it
	will be killed without dumping a core.

	Fixed a typo in the definition of XFSDUMP in config.h-irix.

	Removed the extra option.s-* and copied options.h to
	options.h-vanilla.

	Moved the amrestore manual page into the man directory so it
	would get installed.

Version 2.3.0.1

	amindex-0.1 written by Alan McIvor <alan@kauri.auck.irl.cri.nz>
	installed.  amindex generates an index of all of the files that
	were dumped.  It is nice to see what files were dumped before
	you restore a whole bunch of tapes looking for a file.  I
	patched some of this code.  Here are some of the changes:

		Switched the Imakefile to Makefile and Makefile.in to
		be more consistent with the system used by the rest of
		amanda.

		Moved the configuration #defines out of the specific
		files (such as amrecover.c) into options.h, so that
		people installing this version of amanda would be able
		to see the required changes more easily and not have to
		edit multiple files.

		Made some changes to the codes to remove #include's
		where amanda.h would include them and also check if the
		system had the particular include file.

		Added code to set_commands.c and amgetidx.c to change
		/'s in disk names to _'s.

		Added code to amrecover.c to properly compile on
		Solaris hosts.

		With the -Xc compiler option on Solaris and with
		amindex, the sigaction structure was not being
		declared.  Added -D__EXTENSIONS__ to config.h-sunos5 so
		that sigaction would be declared.

		I changed a bunch of fprintf to perrors.

	Include Sean Kelly's <kelly@fsl.noaa.gov> patch for tools/munge
	for FreeBSD-2.1.5.

	Used Peter Lackner's <plo@came.sbg.ac.at> patches for DU 4.0.

	Installed Ken Laprade's <klaprade@harris.com> patches for
	amanda to handle both EFS and XFs file systems on the same
	client.  The only change from his patch is to #ifdef XFSDUMP
	the kill(-dumppid, SIGTERM) so the SIGTERM signal will be used
	on other systems, while SIGQUIT will be used on Irix systems.

	Installed Marion Hakanson's <hakanson@cse.ogi.edu> patches for
	the main config file to include subsidiary config files.

	On Solaris, sometimes the hdr->handle variable in amandad.c
	would be null, causing core dumps when it was used in a sprintf
	statement.  The code now checks if hdr->handle is null and
	prints a "" if it is null.  This was only done in amandad.c.

	Fix a problem where new disks would be added but not backed up
	concurrently.  Changes to diskfile.c.  I forgot who put this
	patch up on the mailing list.

	I made some changes to options.h to allow the user to more
	easily install the programs under a different user.  This meant
	defining two new #defines, MK_AMANDA_USER and
	MK_QUOTED_AMANDA_USER which are used in the appropriate
	Makefiles.

	Used Marion Hakanson's <hakanson@cse.ogi.edu> patch for taper.c
	for multiple tapes.

	Included Joachim Loehr's <Joachim.Loeh@stadt-mh.de>
	script to automatically figure out which kind of HP-UX file
	system is being dumped.  Look in tools for the script and a
	README.
